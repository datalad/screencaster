# DataLad's cast helpers

This repository hosts a collection of different cast helpers to transform code
casts into different formats.
These tools - while a bit dated and likely in need of customizations to your
particular system - can be useful to create code demonstrations for talks,
videos, or documention.

- ``cast2asciinema`` creates an [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) from your
  code
- ``cast2narration`` creates text-to-speech output from a screencast script
- ``cast2rst`` turns an asciinema asciicast  into an RST markup
- ``cast2script`` converts a cast to a script
- ``cast_live`` creates a remote controlled terminal that can execute a code
  cast line-wise
- ``cast_bash.rc`` contains the bash configuration used by some cast helpers
